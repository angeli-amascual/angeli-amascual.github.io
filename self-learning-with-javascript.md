The first programming language I learned was Java, and that was during my first semester as a Computer Science major. Everything I was learning back then was so new and unfamiliar to me, causing me to worry about how difficult it'd be to learn other programming languages in the future. This past week I've been self-learning basic Javascript through freecodecamp and it brought back those past memories and made me realize how much I've changed since then.

## Background and first thoughts

Prior to delving into Javascript I was knowledgable in both Java and C, with some (but not a lot of) experience in C++. With those three languages as my background, things like syntax and concepts such as functions and arrays were not incredibly difficult to understand. Many parts of Javascript reminded me of Java and C and my background in those languages definitely helped my overall learning experience. However, one part about Javascript that differed from the past languages I've learned are the variables. 

As opposed to having variable types such as "int","float","string","char", etc., the realization that javascript (in the case of the freecodecamp lesson) used "var" to define any type of variable was very surprising it and took a while to get used to. After learning a bit more I also realized that there were also things like "const" and "let" to define variables. However, it was still so out of the box compared to the variable types used in Java and C.
