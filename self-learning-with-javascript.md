The first programming language I learned was Java, and that was during my first semester as a Computer Science major. Everything I was learning back then was so new and unfamiliar to me, causing me to worry about how difficult it'd be to learn other programming languages in the future. This past week I've been self-learning basic Javascript through freecodecamp and it brought back those past memories and made me realize how much I've changed since then.

## Background and First Thoughts

Prior to delving into Javascript I was knowledgable in both Java and C, with some (but not a lot of) experience in C++. With those three languages as my background, things like syntax and concepts such as functions and arrays were not incredibly difficult to understand. Many parts of Javascript reminded me of Java and C and my background in those languages definitely helped my overall learning experience. However, one part about Javascript that I noticed which significantly differed from the past languages I've learned are variables. 

As opposed to having variable types such as "int","float","string","char", etc., the realization that javascript (in the case of the freecodecamp lesson) used "var" to define any type of variable was very surprising it and took a while to get used to. After learning a bit more I also realized that there were also things like "const" and "let" to define variables. However, it was still so out of the box compared to the variable types used in Java and C. 

## Opinion and Future Possibilities

As a whole, I think Javascript is a pretty decent language. However, with the addition of Javascript I only have three languages (3.5 if counting the little experience I have with c++) under my belt. Pairing that with the fact that I've only learned the basics of the language so far it's possible for my opinion to change in the future. In addition, through a little research as well as spoken word from my peers I've realized that javascript is a necessary language for Web Development. Since I have an interest in that field I look forward to continuing to learn the language as well as practicing with it. 

## A New Learning Style

The reason why I started learning Javascript was for my ICS 314: Software Engineering class. As opposed to a normal classroom setting, a lot of the learning for this class is done outside of classtime and during the student's personal time. 

I'm not completely unfamiliar with this type of learning and some of my past Computer Science classes have actually used this style. In a way it's beneficial because it allows me to learn at my own pace and if I don't understand a specific section I can go back until I can understand my material. On the other hand however, this class is also proving to be very time consuming. Since I'm a full time student I need to manage my time carefully so I can devote enough time to this class while still doing work for my other classes.

### A Stressful Opponent: Workout of the Day

Another aspect of this class besides self-learning is the introduction of Workout of the Day's or WOD's for short.
