Computer Science is a very broad term that encompasses many different fields. As a current student of ICS 314: Software Engineering 1, I am starting to learn more about those fields as well as gain an idea of what I'm interested in pursuing further into the future.

### Where My Interests Lie

Although I have not learned much regarding it, I am interested in Mobile Development. From what I've seen of it through videos and what I've read from online articles it seems like a very interesting area. I'm also interested in Software Development as well as Web Development. In fact, the latter is what made me decide to choose Computer Science as my major in the first place. Finally, I'm also interested in Game Development. However, I have heard it is not a very stable field to enter. Therefore, I'm not looking towards entering it professionally but I'd like to learn it on the side to possible develop games as a hobby.

Through taking more ICS classes at UH Manoa I hope to learn more about the above interests and gain experience with them. In addition, from the three topics listed above, I hope to find one that I like enough to do professionally. However, even though I presently find either of them appealing, I do not have much experience with any of them which may lead to my opinion changing. It is also possible for me to develop an interest in a completely different area. Thinking of things this way, it makes me excited for future classes to come.

### Future Goals

In the future I want to be able to think quickly and creatively in order to improve my coding speed. Thankfully, Workout of the Day's are helping me to accomplish this and I look forward to continuing them in this class. Another future goal I have is that I want is to be able to debug my code in a more efficient way. When my code doesn't work I often google the code error or print lines to the console to determine where the bug is. I'd like to learn any other options for debugging code for future use. In addition, I'd like to gain more experience with coding in a team-setting. I will likely have to work in a team in the future for work purposes and so I believe gaining more interest in doing so will only benefit me in the future.
