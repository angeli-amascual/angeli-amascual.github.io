Recently I was introduced to UI Frameworks (User Interface Frameworks). Previously when using IntelliJ IDEA to create websites it was through writing pure HTML and CSS code. Now however, I'm learning how to use Semantic UI and incorporating it into my code. 

### Tricky Hurdles Encountered

Although I'm now using Semantic UI to create websites, it was just a couple weeks ago that I learned how the how-to's and rules for HTML/CSS. Due to that, I sometimes still have to look things up in order to make sure I'm using the right syntax for my code. Adding in Semantic UI which is even newer to me adds to that even further. 

Just today I had to recreate a website for an in-class timed assignment and I was struggling because parts of my site wasn't coming out how I intended them to be. It was only after closely looking through each line of code that I realized slight word variations as well as spelling mistakes in my code that wasn't caught by IntelliJ Idea as an error. An example of both can be seen below.

My code:
```
<div class="ui centered aligned container"> // Incorred word variation
font stlye: italic; //Spelling Error
```

But it was supposed to be:

```
<div class="ui center aligned container">
font stlye: italic;
```
