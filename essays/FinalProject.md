### Overview
The problem: Students are interested in doing many activities but itâ€™s no fun doing them alone. 

The solution: Create a website/application that allows students to find others who are interested in doing similar things. 

### Mockup Page Ideas
- Landing Page
- Home Page
- Sign up
- Profile Page
- Match/Search Page
- Popular Events Page
- Create Events Page
- Edit Events Page
- Invite Page
- Friend Page
- Event Page
- Review Page

### Use Case Ideas
1. A new user goes to the landing page, signs up, is sent to home page, sets up profile page, goes to the create events page (to create an event). 
2. User goes to landing page, logs in, creates event, invites friend, goes to edit events page. 
3. User logs in, user goes to the search/match page, goes to event page, goes to the invite page.
4. User logs in, user goes to the popular events page, goes to event page, goes to invite page.

### Beyond the basics
-Login using UH CAS
-Connection to Google Calendar
-Social media connections (on profile page?)
