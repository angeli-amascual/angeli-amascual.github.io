summary: A project using C language which manages a database of records

For my ICS 212 class we had to complete a project which involved creating a working database of records over a series of homework assignments. Often we were assigned to first write out psuedocode for an assigned section of the project (i.e. Write psuedocode to add/delete a record) before actually coding. Then, we had to take all of the assignments which focused on one area of the code and put them together to make a single functioning program.

This program allowed the user to add records, print a record, print all records, as well as delete records. Extra features also include a debug mode and a read and write aspect which saved records from the previous time the program ran.

Through this project I learned how to efficiently write psuedocode to help make writing code easier. I also received experience in programming using the C language. In addition, I learned about other aspects such as how to use Makefile and SCCS.
